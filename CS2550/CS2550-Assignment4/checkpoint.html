    <h1>CHECKPOINT - ASSIGNMENT 4</h1>
    <p><b>Progress is indicated by color. <span style="color: green">Green</span> is functioning and <span
                style="color: red">Red </span>is not functioning</b></p>
    <h2>Game Logic Required</h2>
    <ul>
        <li style="color: green">Table caption displays correct month/year</li>
        <li style="color: green">Each cell displays correct date and day of week</li>
        <li style="color: green">2D array updates dynamically according javascript Date methods </li>
        <li style="color: green">Select menu allows you to select desired Month</li>
        <li style="color: green">Changing select menu option updates calendar caption date</li>
        <li style="color: red">Each cell displays correct date when month is changed</li>
        <li style="color: green">Coordinates of currently selected cell is displayed</li>
        <li style="color: green">Clicking on cell allows you to create an event</li>
        <li style="color: red">Create a function to delete events</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>How to test logic</h2>
    <p><b>Table Caption:</b> Click Select Menu >> Choose different Month</p>
    <p><b>2D Array: </b> Although this is backend and you aren't looking for this, the grid is printed in console. This
        grid is used to populate the
        date on cells. Right now, it is bugged when changing months. </p>
    <p><b>Select options: </b>Same steps as the Table Caption. Console displays a message when the function returns.
    </p>
    <p><b>Event Creation</b> Click within cell >> A text field and button are created >> Enter information in text box
        >> Click "Add Event" Button</p>
    <p><b>Coordinates of Cell:</b>Same steps as Event Creation. When you click in the cell, coordinates are displayed
        above the Calendar and below the Page Title in the format [row][column]</p>

    <h2>What's left?</h2>
    <p>I have most of the logic I need for this calendar to function, I'd say I have ~80% of needed functionality for
        what i envisioned when i started this project . I'll be honest, I don't know how I will manage to
        delete events. I'll also probably struggle to figure out how to retain events when I switch between months. The
        better design would probably be to find a way to create objects with properties, but this event calendar has
        proven far more complicated than I imagined. I'm not sure I'll have the time to rethink and redraw everything
        up. I imagine there'd be a way to model it so that Each month could be an object, with cell properties who are
        objects themselves, who will have event properties </p>
