    <h1>PROJECT DOCUMENTATION-FINAL PROJECT</h1>
    <h2>HOW WAS IT IMPLEMENTED?</h2>

    <h2>Calendar Implementation</h2>
    <p><b>Table:</b> The table was created using html code that was generated by javascript in view.js, using functions
        from model.js</p>
    <p><b>Arrays:</b> 2D arrays contain the proper dates for each corresponding cell. </p>
    <p><b>Dates:</b>Actual dates are generated by creating a new "DATE" object. Using methods of that object, I get the
        Month, Year, and first weekday of the month.
    </p>
    <p><b>2D Array insertion: </b> A for loop in getCorrectDateInfo() is used to update the grid with dates</p>
    <p><b>2D array update when changing month: </b>A near identical for loop is used to update the array and the
        corresponding grid cells using the updatedGetCorrectDateInfo() function</p>
    <p><b>Selected Cell: </b>A simple function updatedSelectedCell(row,column) updates the innerHTML of the element
        showing the coordinates on the Calendar. </p>
    <p><b>On click event creation: </b>When cells are first generated by javascript, they are dynamically assigned an ID
        name according to it's [row][column] position. This allows me to create a div container on top of the cell that
        has been
        clicked on(A click returns the cell ID, which is [row][column]). A variable is created, its content is html
        code that creates a textfield and button for creating events. That variable is then assigned as the innerHTML of
        the container div.I append the div to the cell </p>
    <p><b>Changing Months</b> A select element is generated by javascript, the options are months of the year. Onclick,
        they activate the updateMonth() function.</p>
    <p><b>updateMonth(): </b> This assigns the correct corresponding dates with the cell according to the chosen
        month(You can compare to a real calendar, it is correct). After than, it calls the function
        requestCalendarJson()</p>
    <p><b>requestCalendarJson():</b> This function is responsible for XMLHttprequests. It pulls info from the
        sample.json
        file and updates the grid with the events parsed form the JSON file</p>
    <p><b>sample.json: </b> The all encompasing object in this file is the year "2019". Properties of "2019" are months
        of the year("January, February, March, etc"). The property within each month is a 2D array, which is parsed and
        used to update the original 2D array used to generate the calendar in the first place.</p>

    <h2><u>All app requirements are satisfied</u></h2>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Game grid uses CSS and generated by Javascript:</b> Generated by view.js, using functions from
                model.js.
                Styling comes from style.css</li>
            <li><b>User Input(text,select options,buttons):</b> User input is used both on index.html, and in
                calendar.html. Select options change the month, field/buttons are used after clicking on cells to create
                events</li>
            <li><b>User input via mouse clicks: </b>User input is used when they click on mouse cells</li>
            <li><b>Dynamic modification of HTML using innerHTML or DOM functions: </b>
                Functions that accomplish this:
                <ul>
                    <li>ajax.js: makeRequest() - Line 30</li>
                    <li>index.js: requestForIndex() - Line 19 </li>
                    <li>model.js: createCalEvent() - Line 124 </li>
                    <li>model.js: submitNewEvent() - Line 137 </li>
                    <li>AND MORE</li>
                </ul>
            <li><b>Use of XMLHttpRequest to load JSON: </b>ajax.js: makeRequest() - line 10 and index.js:
                requestForIndex() - line 2 both make use of the xmlhttprequest to load JSON. JSON is parsed and
                displayed both on the game description page and on the calendar grid. </li>
            </li>
            <li><b>HTML5 video: </b>located on index.html line 26. It begins playing when javascript function is called
                located in index.js: line 42</li>

        </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>Calendar Logic</h2>
    <p>As demonstrated in the video, the website has reasonable functionality and all requirements are satisfied. The
        extra code logic needed beyond what we were assigned has been added and functions properly.</p>
